- Started by reading and understanding what the project required.
- Identified the things I need to make happen, like taking user food order.
- Thought about the if-else statements, switch cases, and parsing that I learned in our sessions.
  Thought about how these could help me in different parts of the project.
- Broke it to smaller steps
- Started to code step by step, checking if each step worked before moving on.
  If something didn't work, I fixed it right away.
- Added a comment in the code to explain that part of code.
